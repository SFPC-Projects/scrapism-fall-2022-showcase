While uncovering their schemes, she seeks to highlight their dysfunction, both visually and critically, by probing the soil and structural layers of obfuscation. She creates experiments ranging from the size of the sheet of paper to the volume of a space; somewhere between writing, archiving, drawing, performing, designing, and programming. <br/><br/>
        Bouquet is a resident of LaMezz in Pierre Bénite, a recipient of the Jean-Luc Lagardère Fondation Grant, a former resident at the School For Poetic Computation, Les Storygraphes, and Le Bel Ordinaire.

        It is common for people to rely on TV and radio updates to stay informed about the weather and prepare for typhoons. With up to 20 typhoons occurring each year, it is essential for Filipinos to have access to accurate and timely information about potential class suspensions, crop protection measures, and evacuation needs. However, two years ago, the government shut down ABS-CBN, the largest TV network in the country that provided extensive disaster coverage on free airwaves. While there are many other news sources available, they do not have the same reach or coverage as ABS-CBN and Facebook has become a leading source of news for the country's 83.85 million users. <br/>
        It is of interest to examine the language used to discuss the weather on the internet. In particular, it is worth exploring how people and institutions talk about the weather in a country that frequently experiences typhoons. <br/>
        The collection includes nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives from English weather news headlines from the Philippines. <br/><br/>
